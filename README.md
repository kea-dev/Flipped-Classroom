# Flipped-Classroom
Companion repository to [Flipped Classroom](https://docs.kea.dev/posts/flipped-classroom/).

# Activities
1. Each class must [create a fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) of this repo - but _only one for each class!_ - so you must plan it as a joint effort!
2. In the new repo ensure that [everyone in class is added as collaborator](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository).
4. Each colloborator must go and create a new issue (in the fork) based on the `Handle Description File` template - leave the issue body unchange - only change the title  - replace `[HANDEL]` - with your actual handle name.
3. Each individual collaborator must use [an online editor](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/creating-new-files) too follow the instructions in the isseue they just created.
